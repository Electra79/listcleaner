# listcleaner

This python script is designed to remove any entries from dictionary files that are outside of a user specified range. This can come in handy in cases such as WPA/WPA2 cracking where the password can't be less than 8 character and more than 63 characters.

USAGE
Note that this script currently only supports UTF-8 files and cannot distinguish between comments and regular file lines.
For best results remove any comments in the file you are cleaning.
